# Welcome to IGCFS

IGC For Science is a project to provide an open platform for sharing and processing IGC flight files. [International Gliding Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAI_Gliding_Commission) is the international governing body for the sport of gliding. It is governed by meetings of delegates from national gliding associations. [IGCFS project website](https://igcfs.github.io/about/) is an effort to make sharing, distributing, and processing of gliding flight files easy.

Check the details about the project on the **[IGCFS website](https://igcfs.github.io)** for more details.


## Project status: in development

There is currently no working build for the distributed file system module.
Stay tuned. 


## Project modules and dependencies

This project uses code from IPFS project with modifications to restrict it to the IGC files only.

This list is work-in-progress:
* libp2p: Go implementation of basic p2p networking stack
* IPFS: Go implementation of IPFS
* IGC: Go library for processing and managing IGC files (originally forked from ezgliding/goigc)
